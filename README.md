# Web Scraping | Rent Research


This is Web Scraping project that grabs data from advertising site and puts in a .CSV table using google forms, pandas and BeautifulSoup.

The project shows that I know how to use BeautifulSoup, Selenium and requests. If necessary for solving specific tasks code could be improved.

The Project was written using bs4(BeautifulSoup), requests, pandas and time libraries.
